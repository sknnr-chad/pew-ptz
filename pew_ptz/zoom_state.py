"""
Read Zoom's *actual* mute/video state via Windows UI Automation.

Zoom's in-meeting toolbar exposes the mute/video buttons through UIA, and
their accessible names flip with state:

    "mute my microphone"   -> mic is currently UNMUTED  (the button mutes you)
    "unmute my microphone" -> mic is currently MUTED
    "start video"          -> video is currently OFF
    "stop video"           -> video is currently ON

So we walk the Zoom meeting window every ~1.5s in a background thread and
return ground truth instead of guessing from the toggles we sent.

Requires the user to have enabled, in Zoom Workplace 7.x:
    Settings -> Meetings & Webinars -> Controls -> "Keep meeting controls visible"
(In older Zoom builds this was Settings -> Accessibility -> "Always show
meeting controls".) Without it the toolbar auto-hides a few seconds after
the last mouse move and the buttons drop out of the UIA tree.
