# Architecture

This is a single-process Flask app with three responsibilities:

1. Translate HTTP requests from the operator's phone into **VISCA-over-IP**
   UDP packets aimed at the camera.
2. Translate the "TOGGLE AIR" requests into **keyboard events** (`Alt+V`,
   `Alt+A`) delivered to whatever window is focused on the host PC — which
   needs to be the Zoom client.
3. Read Zoom's **actual** mute/video state via Windows UI Automation in a
   background thread so the on-air pills reflect reality and not just the
   toggles we sent.

There is no database, no auth, no persistence. The camera stores its own
presets; the app just sends recall commands.

## Why the server lives on the Zoom host PC

`pynput` synthesizes OS-level keystrokes. They go to whatever window has
focus. To mute Zoom, the keystrokes have to be generated **on the Zoom PC
itself** — you can't send `Alt+V` over a network to a different machine
and have Zoom receive it.

That single constraint pins the server's location. Everything else (the
phone UI, the camera) is on the LAN by happy coincidence.

## Why the camera control is HTTP, not WebSocket

Hold-to-move uses `pointerdown` → POST drive command, `pointerup` → POST stop
command. Two HTTP requests per gesture. On a LAN this is well under 10 ms
round-trip and no slower than a WebSocket would be for this volume of
traffic, while keeping the server trivial.

If you ever wanted continuous-speed control (analog joystick on the phone),
WebSocket would start paying for itself. We don't.

## VISCA-over-IP framing

`pew_ptz/visca.py` implements the standard Sony VISCA-over-IP wire format.
Every UDP packet to port 52381 looks like:

```
| 0x01 0x00 | length(2 BE) | seq(4 BE) | VISCA payload (variable) |
```

- `0x0100` — payload type "VISCA command"
- `length` — number of bytes in the VISCA payload
- `seq` — monotonic per-socket counter; the camera echoes it on reply
- VISCA payload — the standard `81 … FF` Sony VISCA frame

The reply uses the same header (with payload type `0x01 0x11` for ACK /
completion). We read with a short timeout and discard — we don't gate UI
responsiveness on it.

A `threading.Lock` serializes sequence-number increment + send so concurrent
requests can't collide on the same socket.

## Pan/tilt-drive byte layout

```
81 01 06 01  VV  WW  XX  YY  FF
              │   │   │   │
              │   │   │   └── tilt direction: 01 up, 02 down, 03 stop
              │   │   └────── pan direction:  01 left, 02 right, 03 stop
              │   └────────── tilt speed (1..0x14)
              └────────────── pan speed (1..0x18)
```

If you only want to move on one axis, set the *other* axis's direction to
`0x03` (stop). E.g., "up" is `pan_dir=03, tilt_dir=01`. The `DIRS` table in
`server.py` encodes all eight diagonals + cardinals this way.

## Zoom state via UI Automation

`pew_ptz/zoom_state.py` runs a daemon thread that polls Zoom's in-meeting
toolbar via Windows UIA every 1.5 s. The mute and video buttons advertise
their *current* state through their accessible names, e.g.:

| Button name (substring) | What it tells us |
|---|---|
| `currently unmuted` | mic is on |
| `currently muted` | mic is off |
| `stop my video` | video is on |
| `start my video` | video is off |

(Older Zoom builds use `mute my microphone` / `start video` / etc. — the
matchers handle both.)

Critical implementation details:

- **COM is per-thread on Windows.** The poller calls `comtypes.CoInitialize()`
  on its own thread before any UIA call. Without this, `auto.GetRootControl()`
  throws `WinError -2147221008 ("CoInitialize has not been called")`.
- **Toolbar visibility matters.** Zoom auto-hides the meeting toolbar after
  a few seconds of mouse inactivity, and hidden buttons drop out of the
  UIA tree. The operator must enable
  *Zoom → Settings → Meetings & Webinars → Controls → "Keep meeting
  controls visible"* (in Zoom Workplace 7.x; older builds had this under
  *Accessibility*).
- **Meeting window class.** Zoom Workplace 7.x uses
  `ConfMultiTabContentWndClass` for both meetings and webinars. Older builds
  used `ZPMeetingWndClass`/`ZPContentViewWndClass`. The `Zoom Workplace`
  launcher window (`ZPPTMainFrmWndClassEx`) does *not* host the meeting
  toolbar and is explicitly skipped.

When UIA gives us a state, `_public_state` returns it with `observed: true`.
When the toolbar is hidden or no meeting is active, `observed: false` and the
UI falls back to the optimistic state (last toggle we sent). After every
toggle, the server pre-syncs the optimistic state from UIA before flipping,
so one tap from a drifted state can't compound the drift.

## Porting to macOS or Linux

Camera control is OS-agnostic — pure socket code. Zoom hotkey injection is
the only Windows-flavored bit, and even that is mostly true on macOS:

- **macOS**: Zoom uses `Cmd+Shift+V` (video) and `Cmd+Shift+A` (mic). Replace
  the `_alt_chord` helper with a Cmd+Shift chord. `pynput` works on macOS
  but requires Accessibility permission for the Python interpreter.
- **Linux**: Zoom hotkeys are configurable in-app and `pynput` works under
  X11 (less reliably under Wayland). You'll likely need to run the server
  on a desktop session, not headless.

The UIA-based state reader is Windows-only — `uiautomation` is gated to
`sys_platform == 'win32'` in `pyproject.toml`. On other platforms the server
falls back to optimistic-state mode.

If you're not on Windows, the server still starts and the camera still works;
the Zoom endpoints just return 500 with `keyboard unavailable on this host`.

## Running unattended

For Sunday-morning operation the server is registered as a per-user
**Scheduled Task** that runs at logon of the operator account. Do not use
a Windows service: services run in Session 0 by default and can't deliver
keystrokes to an interactive desktop, which breaks `pynput`.

The full setup is automated by [`scripts/install.ps1`](../scripts/install.ps1).
It will:

- Ensure Python 3.14 is installed (via winget) and create `.venv`
- Install the package, including `uiautomation`
- Open Windows Firewall on TCP 8080 (Private profile only)
- Register a Scheduled Task `Pew PTZ Controller`:
  - Trigger: At logon of the operator user (default `Chapel-AV`)
  - Action: a generated `scripts/launch.cmd` that sets `PEW_PTZ_LOG_DIR` and
    `PEW_PTZ_SERVER_PORT` then launches `pythonw.exe -m pew_ptz`
  - Settings: restart-on-failure (1 min interval, 999 attempts), no
    execution time limit, run only when user is logged on
- Drop a `Pew PTZ.url` shortcut on the operator's desktop

The two non-obvious requirements baked in:

1. **Run only when user is logged on** (not "whether or not user is logged
   on") — so we get a proper desktop session and pynput can target windows.
2. **Launch via `pythonw.exe`** so no console window pops up on the booth PC.

The Zoom client still has to be the foreground window when an air button is
tapped. That's a Zoom limitation, not ours.
