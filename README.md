# pew-ptz

**Run a broadcast from a phone in your seat.** A small, self-hosted web app
that turns any **VISCA-over-IP PTZ camera** into something you can drive from
the couch / pew / back row, and gives you bidirectional **Zoom mute & video
toggles** that actually work from a phone.

No cloud, no accounts, no app to install. Connect to the LAN, open a URL on
your phone, run the show.

## Why this exists

You're operating a broadcast from somewhere that isn't a control booth. A
pew during a service. A folding chair at a conference. The back of a small
hall. You don't want to walk to a PC every time you need to mute Zoom or
nudge the camera.

Two things make that miserable today:

1. **PTZ remotes are line-of-sight IR.** Sit in the wrong spot or have
   someone slide in front of you and the remote stops working.
2. **Zoom mobile won't let a co-host *unmute* a different participant.** It
   *will* mute / stop video — so the moment you cut the broadcast, your only
   way back on the air is to physically walk to the broadcast PC. Mid-event,
   that's exactly the wrong time to be moving around.

This app collapses both jobs onto one phone screen on the local Wi-Fi:

1. **PTZ over the LAN, not IR** — sit anywhere with line-of-sight to the
   Wi-Fi router, not to the camera. Hold-to-move D-pad, hold-to-zoom,
   named presets, and a sticky live preview pinned to the top of the page.
2. **Bidirectional Zoom toggles** — the server runs on the broadcast PC and
   sends Zoom's own keyboard shortcuts (`Alt+V`, `Alt+A`) to the foreground
   Zoom window. They're toggles, so the same button takes you off-air *and*
   brings you back.
3. **Ground-truth Zoom state** — Windows UI Automation reads the actual
   Zoom toolbar so the on-air pills can't drift out of sync with reality.

Everything is on the local network. Nothing leaves the building.

## Compatibility

### Cameras

Anything that speaks **VISCA-over-IP** (the Sony-style protocol most
broadcast PTZs implement). Confirmed or expected to work:

- ClearTouch RL500 *(the reference deployment)*
- PTZOptics Move/Studio Pro/Eagle/Hive series
- Sony BRC / SRG series
- AVer CAM/PTC series
- Marshall CV-series PTZ
- HuddleCam HC series
- BirdDog PTZ family
- Lumens VC-A series
- Most Chinese OEM PTZs sold under various brands

The packet builders in [`pew_ptz/visca.py`](pew_ptz/visca.py) implement the
spec verbatim — they don't carry vendor extensions. As long as your camera
accepts VISCA on UDP 52381, the camera control will work.

If your firmware uses **TCP 5678** for VISCA instead of UDP 52381 (some
older PTZOptics, some OEM rebrands), or only exposes an HTTP CGI control
surface, [`docs/ptz-cameras.md`](docs/ptz-cameras.md) has the swap recipes.

### Live preview

The preview tile uses an HTTP snapshot URL (default `/snapshot.jpg`) polled
~2.5 fps from the phone. Vendor paths vary — set `PEW_PTZ_CAMERA_SNAPSHOT_PATH`
to whatever your camera uses. Common ones:

| Vendor / firmware | Snapshot path |
|---|---|
| ClearTouch RL500, many OEMs | `/snapshot.jpg` |
| Hikvision-style ISAPI | `/Streaming/channels/1/picture` |
| Generic CGI | `/cgi-bin/snapshot.cgi` |
| Axis | `/axis-cgi/jpg/image.cgi` |

If your camera only exposes RTSP, see
[`docs/ptz-cameras.md`](docs/ptz-cameras.md#cameras-without-an-http-snapshot) —
the short version is "browsers can't play RTSP, you'll need a small
transcoder like MediaMTX, and it's out of scope for this project."

### Host PC (the Zoom PC)

- **Windows** is the primary target. The included installer
  ([`scripts/install.ps1`](scripts/install.ps1)) ensures Python 3.14 via
  winget, sets up a venv, opens the firewall, and registers a per-user
  Scheduled Task. UI-Automation-based Zoom state readback is Windows-only.
- **macOS / Linux** work for camera control but the Zoom hotkey injection
  needs swapping (`Cmd+Shift+V`/`Cmd+Shift+A` on macOS) and you lose the
  state readback. See
  [`docs/architecture.md#porting-to-macos-or-linux`](docs/architecture.md#porting-to-macos-or-linux).

---

## Install (Windows, unattended)

```powershell
# 1. Get the code
git clone https://github.com/sknnr-chad/pew-ptz.git C:\tools\pew-ptz

# 2. Run the installer as Administrator
cd C:\tools\pew-ptz
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force
.\scripts\install.ps1
```

[`scripts/install.ps1`](scripts/install.ps1) is idempotent. It will:

- Install Python 3.14 via winget if missing
- Create `.venv` and install the package
- Open Windows Firewall on TCP 8080 (Private profile only)
- Register a Scheduled Task **At logon of the operator user** with
  restart-on-failure (runs under the user session so `pynput` can reach Zoom)
- Drop a desktop shortcut to `http://localhost:8080`

Defaults match the reference deployment: install dir `C:\tools\pew-ptz`,
operator user `Chapel-AV`. Override with
`-InstallDir`, `-TaskUser`, `-Port` if you need to.

After install, log in as the operator user (or reboot if auto-login is set)
and hit `http://<host-pc-lan-ip>:8080` from the operator's phone on the
same Wi-Fi.

**Required Zoom setting (one-time):**
**Settings → Meetings & Webinars → Controls → "Keep meeting controls visible"**.
Without this the toolbar auto-hides and the UIA-based state reader can't see
the mute/video buttons. The pills will fall back to optimistic mode.

To remove: `.\scripts\uninstall.ps1` (leaves the source tree in place).

### Just want to try it from a laptop

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/sknnr-chad/pew-ptz.git
cd pew-ptz
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e .
$env:PEW_PTZ_CAMERA_IP = "192.168.1.50"   # your camera's LAN IP
pew-ptz
```

Then on the phone: `http://<your-laptop-ip>:8080`. The Zoom Meeting card
will say "keyboard unavailable" — fine, camera control still works.

---

## Dependencies

`pyproject.toml` declares version ranges; `requirements.txt` is the
hash-pinned lockfile the installer actually installs from, so every host
gets the same tested versions. It is resolved for Windows / Python 3.12+.
After changing dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, regenerate it with:

```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml --python-version 3.12 --python-platform windows --generate-hashes -o requirements.txt
```

Dependabot proposes weekly updates to both files.

### Tests

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff check .
pytest
```

The tests replace the camera and keyboard with stubs, so they never move a
real camera or press keys on your desktop. CI runs ruff on Linux and the tests
on Windows (Python 3.12 and 3.14) for every push to `main` and every PR.

## Per-ward presets

Several wards can share the chapel camera, each with its own set of named
positions. Selecting a ward shows only that ward's presets; **No ward** shows
the `shared` list (the original chapel presets). Copy `presets.example.json` to `presets.json` in the
install folder and edit the names:

```json
{
  "shared": ["Speaker", "Pulpit", "Wide"],
  "wards": [
    { "name": "1st Ward", "presets": ["Bishopric", "Choir"] },
    { "name": "2nd Ward", "presets": ["Bishopric", "Organ"] }
  ]
}
```

Restart the controller after editing. Each preset's camera slot comes from its
position in its list:

| Block | Camera slots | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| `shared` (No ward) | 1–15 | 15 presets |
| Ward 1, 2, 3, … | 16–31, 32–47, 48–63, … | 16 presets each, up to 14 wards |

Because slots follow list order, **add new names at the end** of a list;
inserting or reordering names makes them point at different camera slots.

- **Choosing the ward:** the picker in the Presets card sets the active ward
  for *every* phone, and it survives restarts (`active-ward.json`). The buttons
  switch to that ward's presets; HOME goes to its first preset. Only the
  presets on screen can be recalled or saved.
- **The camera's IR remote:** its preset buttons 1–9 recall slots 1–9, i.e. the
  first nine `shared` (No ward) presets, so saving with the remote changes those
  buttons too (verified on the ClearTouch RL500). Ward presets (slots 16+) are
  phone-only.
- **Same names in every ward is fine:** each ward's "Speaker" is its own camera
  slot, so each ward saves its own framing. A new ward's presets start empty;
  save each one (below) before relying on it.
- **Saving positions and renaming from the phone:** aim the camera, tap
  **Edit**, tap a preset, then choose **Save current view here** or
  **Rename…**. Renaming keeps the preset's slot (and saved position) and
  rewrites `presets.json`, keeping the previous version as
  `presets.json.bak`; other phones pick up the new name within a couple of
  seconds. Edit mode turns off after each change, and every save and rename
  is logged with the phone's IP in `server.log`. Buttons can be renamed but
  not added or removed from the phone. Note that `presets.json` is rewritten
  in a standard layout, so hand-added formatting isn't kept.
- **Starting a ward from the original positions:** in a ward's Edit mode, tap
  **Copy No-ward positions into …**. The controller recalls each No-ward
  preset and saves it into the same position in the ward's list, waiting
  `PEW_PTZ_COPY_SETTLE_SECONDS` (default 5) for the camera to arrive each time
  — about a minute for nine. Camera and ward controls are locked until it
  finishes or someone taps **Stop**. If shots come out saved mid-move, raise
  the setting in `.env`.
- **No `presets.json`?** `PEW_PTZ_PRESETS` names are used as shared presets in
  slots 1–9, exactly as before. A malformed file is logged and ignored the same
  way, so a typo never takes the camera controls away.

`presets.json` and `active-ward.json` are git-ignored, so `git pull` never
touches them.

---

## Probing a camera

`scripts/probe-camera.ps1` checks what a camera supports: ping, the snapshot
URL, VISCA-over-IP, position inquiries, and how many preset slots actually
work (including cameras that silently wrap slot numbers). Run it from any
Windows PC on the camera's network; no install or admin needed.

```powershell
.\scripts\probe-camera.ps1 -ReadOnly          # safe: no camera movement
.\scripts\probe-camera.ps1                    # also tests preset slots 64-254
.\scripts\probe-camera.ps1 -VerifyOnly        # after a power cycle
```

The full run **overwrites the preset slots it tests and moves the camera**
(it asks first, and returns the camera to where it started). Choose unused
slots with `-Slots`, and use `-CameraIp` if the camera isn't at the default.

---

## Configuration

All config is environment variables. Put site-specific ones in a **`.env`**
file in the install folder (copy `.env.example`). It's git-ignored and survives
reinstalls, unlike `scripts\launch.cmd`, which the installer rewrites. Real
environment variables win over `.env`. Restart the controller after editing it.

| Var | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PEW_PTZ_CAMERA_IP` | `192.168.100.88` | Camera's LAN address |
| `PEW_PTZ_VISCA_PORT` | `52381` | VISCA-over-IP UDP port |
| `PEW_PTZ_SERVER_PORT` | `8080` | HTTP listen port (served by Waitress) |
| `PEW_PTZ_CAMERA_SNAPSHOT_PATH` | `/snapshot.jpg` | HTTP path on the camera that returns a JPEG (see Compatibility table above) |
| `PEW_PTZ_PRESETS` | (9 chapel presets) | Comma-separated. Slot N on the camera maps to the Nth name (1-indexed). Example: `Wide,Speaker,Audience,Stage Left,Stage Right`. Ignored when `presets.json` exists. |
| `PEW_PTZ_LOG_DIR` | unset | If set, writes `server.log` (rotating, 1 MB × 5) here. The installer points this at `<InstallDir>\logs`. |
| `PEW_PTZ_PRESETS_FILE` | `presets.json` | Shared + per-ward presets (see [Per-ward presets](#per-ward-presets)). Relative to the working directory, which the installer sets to `<InstallDir>`. |
| `PEW_PTZ_TITLE` | `pew-ptz` | Browser-tab and home-screen title, e.g. `Chapel PTZ` |
| `PEW_PTZ_CONTACT_NAME`, `PEW_PTZ_CONTACT_EMAIL`, `PEW_PTZ_CONTACT_PHONE` | unset | Shown as a "Need help?" box at the top of the help page, with tap-to-call and tap-to-email links. Keep them in `.env` so personal details stay out of the repo. |
| `PEW_PTZ_COPY_SETTLE_SECONDS` | `5` | Seconds the "Copy No-ward positions" action waits for the camera to reach each shot before saving it. |
| `PEW_PTZ_SKIP_FOCUS_CHECK` | unset | Set to `1` to bypass the "Zoom must be foreground" guard. Useful for UI testing on a dev box without Zoom. |

## Security model

There is no login. Anyone who can reach the server's port on the LAN has
full camera and Zoom control, so keep it on a trusted network segment
(see [docs/setup-udm7.md](docs/setup-udm7.md)).

The camera's live snapshot stream goes **directly from the phone to the
camera** (see the `<img src="http://{camera_ip}/snapshot.jpg">` in the UI).
Anyone on the LAN who knows the camera IP can pull frames. The camera was
already reachable directly; proxying it through Flask would add Python in
the 400ms snapshot hot path for no real gain in a LAN-only deployment. If you care about gating the video,
restrict the camera's own network access.

`/healthz` is intended for external monitoring and returns only uptime and
whether the keyboard controller loaded. The main UI's state endpoint does
report the name of the host PC's foreground program (e.g. `zoom.exe`) so the
operator can see when Zoom has lost focus; window titles are never sent.

---

## Features

- **Sticky live preview** — `<img>` polls the camera's snapshot URL ~2.5 fps
  and floats at the top of the page as the operator scrolls.
- **D-pad** with diagonals, **hold-to-move** (release = stop) at slow / med /
  fast. Defaults to slow — easier to land a frame on a person.
- **HOME** button recalls preset 1 (typically "Speaker") — the most-used
  framing.
- **Up to N named presets** — recall on tap. The web UI is recall-only by
  design (no `/preset/set` HTTP route) so an operator can't accidentally
  overwrite a preset mid-event. Train them via the camera's web UI or IR
  remote.
- **Hold-to-zoom** at a deliberately slow default (2/7).
- **Autofocus is asserted on at server startup** — the camera can't get
  stuck out of focus after a power-cycle or stray IR poke.
- **One-tap TOGGLE AIR** (video + mic together), green when off-air, red
  when on-air, plus separate Video / Mic toggles for granular use.
- **Ground-truth Zoom state via UI Automation (Windows)** — a background
  thread reads the Zoom toolbar's accessible names so the on-air pills
  reflect reality, not just the toggles we sent. Pre-toggle the optimistic
  state is also re-synced from UIA, so a single tap from a drifted state
  can't compound the drift.
- **100% LAN** — no CDN, no cloud, no telemetry.

## Project status

The reference deployment is a chapel running sacrament-meeting broadcasts
on a ClearTouch RL500. That's why the bundled preset names default to
`Speaker, Choir, Chorister, Piano, Organ, Sacrament, North Stand,
Congregation, Back Row` — they're easy to override via `PEW_PTZ_PRESETS`.

If you adapt this for another deployment, please open an issue or PR with
the camera model, vendor, and any tweaks you needed — the more
camera/firmware combinations confirmed working, the more useful this is.
